# WinForms Designer
A simple WinForms designer written in VB.NET.

It's based on https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/24385/Have-a-Great-DesignTime-Experience-with-a-Powerful but it has a few additional features such as code serialization, incomplete code loading, and xml loading and serialzation. Also several bugs have been fixed.

It will run on .NET 7, but the designer acts a little funky.
